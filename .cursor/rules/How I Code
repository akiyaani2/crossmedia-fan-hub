# 🧠 AI Coding Pattern Preferences

## ✅ General Principles
- Always prefer **simple solutions** that accomplish the task with minimal complexity.
- Avoid **duplication of code** whenever possible. Always check if similar functionality already exists in the codebase before adding new logic.
- Write code with awareness of different environments: **dev, test, and prod**.
- Only make changes that are requested or clearly scoped — ensure you understand the full context before modifying code.
- When fixing bugs, **do not introduce new patterns or tech** without first exhausting all options using the current system. If a new pattern is introduced, remove legacy logic to avoid duplication.
- Keep the codebase **clean and well organized**.

## 🛠️ Code Structure & Scripts
- Avoid writing scripts in files unless they're used multiple times or intended to be part of the core system.
- **Split large files** that grow beyond **200–300 lines** into logical modules or components.
- **Mock data only in test files.** Never mock or inject fake data into dev or prod logic.
- Never add stubs or fake data patterns to production pathways — this risks unexpected behavior.
- Never overwrite the `.env` file without first **asking and confirming**.

## 🧪 Testing & Safety
- Include basic **unit tests** for any new functions or logic.
- Use mocks or fixtures for test data; never call real APIs or use live data during tests.
- Add validation checks to catch issues early (e.g., input format, null checks, range checks).

## 💬 Communication & Clarity
- Always **leave a comment** or update documentation when logic is non-obvious.
- Include relevant context when opening a pull request: what changed, why, and what to test.
- Name functions and variables with clear, descriptive names. Avoid abbreviations unless they’re universally understood.

## 🛡️ Environment Discipline
- Separate config by environment (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.production`) and do not mix.
- Use **feature flags or environment checks** to toggle experimental features.
- Ensure code is deployable in any environment without modification — no hardcoded paths or values.

## ⚠️ Additions (Recommended Rules)
- Use **linting + formatting tools** (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Black) on every commit or PR.
- Add **comments or documentation updates** in the same PR as logic changes.
- Always **review logs and test coverage reports** after CI runs to ensure quality.
