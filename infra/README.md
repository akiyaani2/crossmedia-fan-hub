## Supabase

Refer to the `infra/supabase/README.md` for instructions on running Supabase locally using the Supabase CLI.

If you are using a hosted Supabase project, ensure your environment variables in the respective services (`frontend/.env.local`, `scripts/.env`) are pointing to your cloud Supabase URL and keys.
